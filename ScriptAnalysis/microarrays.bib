One popular analysis method involves fitting the same linear mixed model for each gene, obtaining gene-specific p-values for tests of interest involving fixed effects, and then choosing a threshold for significance that is intended to control false discovery rate (FDR) at a desired level. When one or more random factors have zero variance components for some genes, the standard practice of fitting the same full linear mixed model for all genes can result in failure to control FDR. We propose a new method that combines results from the fit of full and selected linear mixed models to identify differentially expressed genes and provide FDR control at target levels when the true underlying random effects structure varies across genes.",

While accurate prediction can be achieved by means of many different techniques, gene identification, due to gene correlation and the limited number of available samples, is a much more elusive problem. Small changes in the expression values often produce different gene lists, and solutions which are both sparse and stable are difficult to obtain. We propose a two-stage regularization method able to learn linear models characterized by a high prediction performance. By varying a suitable parameter these linear models allow to trade sparsity for the inclusion of correlated genes and to produce gene lists which are almost perfectly nested.

Our web tools attempt to respond to these researchers' needs by facilitating the possibility to test and formulate from a hypothesis to entire models under a holistic point of view. RESULTS: PCOPGene-Net is a web application for facilitating the study of the relationships among gene expressions under microarray conditions, to classify these conditions and to study their effect on expression relationships. Furthermore, the system guides the researcher in the navigation through the microarray data by providing the most suitable genes and information for the researcher's interests at each moment. We achieve all of these by means of the zoom-out operation, the zoom-in operation, the non-continuous analysis and crossing the PCOPGene results with external data-servers. CONCLUSION: PCOPGene-Net helps to identify cellular states and the genes involved in these. All of that is accomplished in a flexible way, guided by the researcher's interests and taking advantage of the ability of our system to relate gene expressions, even when these relationships are non-continuous and cannot be found using linear or non-linear analytical methods.

Many normalization issues associated with the analysis of genomic data are thereby avoided. A prior density based on Ewens' sampling distribution is used to restrict the number of interacting components assigned high posterior probability, and the calculation of posterior model probabilities is expedited by approximations based on the likelihood ratio statistic. Simulation studies are used to evaluate the efficiency of the resulting algorithm for known interaction structures.

	abstract = "Supervised learning of microarray data is receiving much attention in recent years. Multiclass cancer diagnosis, based on selected gene profiles, are used as adjunct of clinical diagnosis. However, supervised diagnosis may hinder patient care, add expense or confound a result. To avoid this misleading, a multiclass cancer diagnosis with class-selective rejection is proposed. It rejects some patients from one, some, or all classes in order to ensure a higher reliability while reducing time and expense costs. Moreover, this classifier takes into account asymmetric penalties dependent on each class and on each wrong or partially correct decision. It is based on nu-1-SVM coupled with its regularization path and minimizes a general loss function defined in the class-selective rejection scheme. The state of art multiclass algorithms can be considered as a particular case of the proposed algorithm where the number of decisions is given by the classes and the loss function is defined by the Bayesian risk. Two experiments are carried out in the Bayesian and the class selective rejection frameworks. Five genes selected datasets are used to assess the performance of the proposed method. Results are discussed and accuracies are compared with those computed by the Naive Bayes, Nearest Neighbor, Linear Perceptron, Multilayer Perceptron, and Support Vector Machines classifiers.",

RESULTS: When classifying cancer patients, the accuracy was 92.59% in the leave-one-out validation method. CONCLUSIONS: SGAS provided PS for the risk of recurrence, which was capable of discriminating a patient's recurrence status. A total of 59 genes were found to have a high frequency of alteration in either the recurrence or non-recurrence status. SGAS was found to be a significant risk factor on recurrence and explained 31% variability of the 59 genes.",

IMT has also been recognized as a quantitative measure of cardiovascular disease progression in asymptomatic individuals, and many candidate gene association studies have attempted to identify genetic variants associated with interindividual differences in IMT with limited success. We sought to test the association between subclinical atherosclerosis measured by IMT and approximately 50,000 SNPs, densely mapping approximately 2100 genes found on the gene-centric Illumina cardiovascular disease beadchip in a multi-ethnic population-based sample. METHODS: IMT was measured by B-mode ultrasound and DNA was collected from a population-based sample of South Asian (n=328), Chinese (n=302), and European Caucasian (n=268) participants. Genetic association was measured using multivariate linear regression including adjustment for covariates. RESULTS: The most robust association across all models tested was observed for a SNP (rs3791398) in histone deacetylase 4 (HDAC4; P=1.8e-5 to P=3.6e-5), while another strong association signal was observed with natriuretic peptide receptor a/guanylate cyclase A (NPR1) (rs10082235, P=5.4e-5). Seven of 13 previously reported functional candidate genes contained a SNP that was marginally associated (0.01 < P < or = 0.05). CONCLUSION: This initial multi-ethnic high-density association study of carotid IMT suggests some novel loci requiring further evaluation in follow-up studies.",

Results were compared using a pathway analysis tool, based on the Gene Ontology and the MeSH database. We could show that both methods lead to time-dependent gene regulatory patterns which fit well to known TNFalpha induced immune responses. In comparison, the nonexclusive attribute of ICA results in a more detailed view and a higher resolution in time dependent behavior of the immune response genes.

The log-ratio of the foreground to background signal is used as a response index. Negative control responses serve as a reference against which ``detectable'' responses can be defined, and slides incubated with only buffer and secondary antibody help identify false-positive responses from peptides.

In the present study, we analyzed proteome changes in Ha-ras and B-raf mutated liver tumors by 2-D gel-electrophoretic separation of proteins followed by their identification by mass spectrometry. In total, 104 significantly altered protein spots were identified in Ha-ras mutated tumors and 111 in B-raf mutated tumors when compared to the corresponding normal liver tissue. The changes in protein expression patterns were highly correlated between Ha-ras and B-raf mutated tumors, and in the majority of the cases, both tumor types showed the respective alteration. Most of the tumor-specific changes in protein expression were reflected by similar changes in their mRNAs except for some up-regulated proteins without accompanying changes in mRNA levels.

The interaction terms for genes and experimental conditions in this model capture all relevant information about differential gene expression in the microarray data. We propose a mixture distribution model for a summary statistic of differential expression that consists of null and alternative component distributions.

Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.",

The method involves fitting separate linear models to the expression data for each gene but with a common value for the between-replicate correlation. The method greatly improves the precision with which the genewise variances are estimated and thereby improves inference methods designed to identify differentially expressed genes. The method may be combined with empirical Bayes methods for moderating the genewise variances between genes. The method is validated using data from a microarray experiment involving calibration and ratio control spots in conjunction with spiked-in RNA. Comparing results for calibration and ratio control spots shows that the common correlation method results in substantially better discrimination of differentially expressed genes from those which are not. The spike-in experiment also confirms that the results may be further improved by empirical Bayes smoothing of the variances when the sample size is small.

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: Many cutting-edge microarray analysis tools and algorithms, including commonly used limma and affy packages in Bioconductor, need sophisticated knowledge of mathematics, statistics and computer skills for implementation. Commercially available software can provide a user-friendly interface at considerable cost. To facilitate the use of these tools for microarray data analysis on an open platform we developed an online microarray data analysis platform, WebArray, for bench biologists to utilize these tools to explore data from single/dual color microarray experiments. RESULTS: The currently implemented functions were based on limma and affy package from Bioconductor, the spacings LOESS histogram (SPLOSH) method, PCA-assisted normalization method and genome mapping method. WebArray incorporates these packages and provides a user-friendly interface for accessing a wide range of key functions of limma and others, such as spot quality weight, background correction, graphical plotting, normalization, linear modeling, empirical bayes statistical analysis, false discovery rate (FDR) estimation, chromosomal mapping for genome comparison.

	abstract = "In microarray experiments, several steps may cause sub-optimal quality and the need for quality control is strong. Often the experiments are complex, with several conditions studied simultaneously. A linear model for paired microarray experiments is proposed as a generalisation of the paired two-sample method by Kristiansson et al. (2005). Quality variation is modelled by different variance scales for different (pairs of) arrays, and shared sources of variation are modelled by covariances between arrays. The gene-wise variance estimates are moderated in an empirical Bayes approach. Due to correlations all data is typically used in the inference of any linear combination of parameters. Both real and simulated data are analysed. Unequal variances and strong correlations are found in real data, leading to further examination of the fit of the model and of the nature of the datasets in general. The empirical distributions of the test-statistics are found to have a considerably improved match to the null distribution compared to previous methods, which implies more correct p-values provided that most genes are non-differentially expressed. In fact, assuming independent observations with identical variances typically leads to optimistic p-values. The method is shown to perform better than the alternatives in the simulation study.",

In particular the power and accuracy of statistical tests for differential gene expressions are highly dependent on variance modelling. The aim of this paper is to use a structural model on the variances, which includes a condition effect and a random gene effect, and to propose a simple estimation procedure for these parameters by working on the empirical variances. The proposed variance model was compared with various methods on both real and simulated data. It proved to be more powerful than the gene-by-gene analysis and more robust to the number of false positives than the homogeneous variance model. It performed well compared with recently proposed approaches such as SAM and VarMixt even for a small number of replicates, and performed similarly to Limma. The main advantage of the structural model is that, thanks to the use of a linear mixed model on the logarithm of the variances, various factors of variation can easily be incorporated in the model, which is not the case for previously proposed empirical Bayes methods. It is also very fast to compute and is adapted to the comparison of more than two conditions.",

	pages = "927--39",
	abstract = "Microarrays provide a valuable tool for the quantification of gene expression. Usually, however, there is a limited number of replicates leading to unsatisfying variance estimates in a gene-wise mixed model analysis. As thousands of genes are available, it is desirable to combine information across genes. When more than two tissue types or treatments are to be compared it might be advisable to consider the array effect as random. Then information between arrays may be recovered, which can increase accuracy in estimation. We propose a method of variance component estimation across genes for a linear mixed model with two random effects. The method may be extended to models with more than two random effects. We assume that the variance components follow a log-normal distribution. Assuming that the sums of squares from the gene-wise analysis, given the true variance components, follow a scaled chi(2)-distribution, we adopt an empirical Bayes approach. The variance components are estimated by the expectation of their posterior distribution. The new method is evaluated in a simulation study. Differentially expressed genes are more likely to be detected by tests based on these variance estimates than by tests based on gene-wise variance estimates. This effect is most visible in studies with small array numbers. Analyzing a real data set on maize endosperm the method is shown to work well.",

	abstract = "Many different methods have been proposed for the analysis of cluster randomized trials (CRTs) over the last 30 years. However, the evaluation of methods on overdispersed count data has been based mostly on the comparison of results using empiric data; i.e. when the true model parameters are not known. In this study, we assess via simulation the performance of five methods for the analysis of counts in situations similar to real community-intervention trials. We used the negative binomial distribution to simulate overdispersed counts of CRTs with two study arms, allowing the period of time under observation to vary among individuals. We assessed different sample sizes, degrees of clustering and degrees of cluster-size imbalance. The compared methods are: (i) the two-sample t-test of cluster-level rates, (ii) generalized estimating equations (GEE) with empirical covariance estimators, (iii) GEE with model-based covariance estimators, (iv) generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) and (v) Bayesian hierarchical models (Bayes-HM). Variation in sample size and clustering led to differences between the methods in terms of coverage, significance, power and random-effects estimation. GLMM and Bayes-HM performed better in general with Bayes-HM producing less dispersed results for random-effects estimates although upward biased when clustering was low. GEE showed higher power but anticonservative coverage and elevated type I error rates. Imbalance affected the overall performance of the cluster-level t-test and the GEE's coverage in small samples.

	abstract = "The brain is widely assumed to be a paradigmatic example of a complex, self-organizing system. As such, it should exhibit the classic hallmarks of nonlinearity, multistability, and ``nondiffusivity'' (large coherent fluctuations). Surprisingly, at least at the very large scale of neocortical dynamics, there is little empirical evidence to support this, and hence most computational and methodological frameworks for healthy brain activity have proceeded very reasonably from a purely linear and diffusive perspective. By studying the temporal fluctuations of power in human resting-state electroencephalograms, we show that, although these simple properties may hold true at some temporal scales, there is strong evidence for bistability and nondiffusivity in key brain rhythms. Bistability is manifest as nonclassic bursting between high- and low-amplitude modes in the alpha rhythm. Nondiffusivity is expressed through the irregular appearance of high amplitude ``extremal'' events in beta rhythm power fluctuations. The statistical robustness of these observations was confirmed through comparison with Gaussian-rendered phase-randomized surrogate data. Although there is a good conceptual framework for understanding bistability in cortical dynamics, the implications of the extremal events challenge existing frameworks for understanding large-scale brain systems.",

These decisions, such as whether or not to restrict public access to a water resource area, may therefore vary depending on how models reflect process, observation, and analytical uncertainty and variability. Nonetheless, few probabilistic modeling tools have been developed which explicitly propagate fecal indicator bacteria (FIB) analysis uncertainty into predictive bacterial water quality model parameters and response variables. Here, we compare three approaches to modeling variability in two different FIB water quality models. We first calibrate a well-known first-order bacterial decay model using approaches ranging from ordinary least squares (OLS) linear regression to Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) procedures. We then calibrate a less frequently used empirical bacterial die-off model using the same range of procedures (and the same data). Finally, we propose an innovative approach to evaluating the predictive performance of each calibrated model using a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure and assessing the probability distributions of the resulting Bayesian posterior predictive p-values. Our results suggest that different approaches to acknowledging uncertainty can lead to discrepancies between parameter mean and variance estimates and predictive performance for the same FIB water quality model. Our results also suggest that models without a bacterial kinetics parameter related to the rate of decay may more appropriately reflect FIB fate and transport processes, regardless of how variability and uncertainty are acknowledged.",

This analysis ultimately results in the production of z-statistic images corresponding to the contrasts of interest. Thresholding such z-statistic images at uncorrected thresholds suitable for testing activation at a single voxel results in the problem of multiple comparisons. A number of methods which account for the problem of multiple comparisons have been proposed including Gaussian random field theory, mixture modeling and false discovery rate (FDR). The focus of this paper is on the development of a generalized version of FDR (GFDR) in an empirical Bayesian framework, specially adapted for fMRI thresholding, that is more robust to modeling violations as compared to traditional FDR. We show theoretically as well as by simulation that for real fMRI data various factors lead to a mixture of Gaussians (MOG) density for the ``null'' distribution. Artificial data was used to systematically study the bias of FDR and GFDR under varying intensity of modeling violations, signal to noise ratios and activation fractions for a range of q values. GFDR was able to handle modeling violations and produce good results when FDR failed. Real fMRI data was also used to confirm GFDR capabilities. Our results indicate that it is very important to account for the form and fraction of the ``null'' hypothesis adaptively from the data in order to obtain valid inference.",

METHOD: Caregiver-child language samples were collected from 20 typically developing children every 3 months from 21 to 33 months of age. Growth in the productivity of tense morphemes, centered at 21 months, was examined using hierarchical linear modeling. The empirical Bayes residuals from 21- to 30-month productivity growth trajectories predicted children's accuracy of tense marking at 33 months. RESULTS: A random effects quadratic growth model with no intercept best characterized the growth of tense marking between 21 and 30 months. Average development was characterized by slow instantaneous linear growth of less than 1 morpheme per month at 21 months and acceleration overall. Significant variation around this trend was also evident. Children's linear and quadratic empirical Bayes residuals together predicted 33-month accuracy scores (r = .672, p = .008). CONCLUSIONS: Acceleration and variation about this trend are consistent with maturational models of language acquisition. With an empirically sound characterization of early variation in morphosyntactic growth rates, future investigations can more rigorously test hypotheses regarding biological, environmental, and developmental contributions to the acquisition of morphosyntax.",

When data are uninformative at the individual level, the EBE distribution will shrink towards zero (eta-shrinkage, quantified as 1-SD(eta (EBE))/omega), IPREDs towards the corresponding observations, and IWRES towards zero (epsilon-shrinkage, quantified as 1-SD(IWRES)). These diagnostics are widely used in pharmacokinetic (PK) pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling; we investigate here their usefulness in the presence of shrinkage. Datasets were simulated from a range of PK PD models, EBEs estimated in non-linear mixed effects modeling based on the true or a misspecified model, and desired diagnostics evaluated both qualitatively and quantitatively. Identified consequences of eta-shrinkage on EBE-based model diagnostics include non-normal and/or asymmetric distribution of EBEs with their mean values (``ETABAR'') significantly different from zero, even for a correctly specified model; EBE-EBE correlations and covariate relationships may be masked, falsely induced, or the shape of the true relationship distorted. Consequences of epsilon-shrinkage included low power of IPRED and IWRES to diagnose structural and residual error model misspecification, respectively. EBE-based diagnostics should be interpreted with caution whenever substantial eta- or epsilon-shrinkage exists (usually greater than 20% to 30%). Reporting the magnitude of eta- and epsilon-shrinkage will facilitate the informed use and interpretation of EBE-based diagnostics.",

	abstract = "BACKGROUND: In several biological contexts, parameter inference often relies on computationally-intensive techniques. ``Approximate Bayesian Computation'', or ABC, methods based on summary statistics have become increasingly popular. A particular flavor of ABC based on using a linear regression to approximate the posterior distribution of the parameters, conditional on the summary statistics, is computationally appealing, yet no standalone tool exists to automate the procedure. Here, I describe a program to implement the method. RESULTS: The software package ABCreg implements the local linear-regression approach to ABC. The advantages are: 1. The code is standalone, and fully-documented. 2. The program will automatically process multiple data sets, and create unique output files for each (which may be processed immediately in R), facilitating the testing of inference procedures on simulated data, or the analysis of multiple data sets. 3. The program implements two different transformation methods for the regression step. 4. Analysis options are controlled on the command line by the user, and the program is designed to output warnings for cases where the regression fails. 5. The program does not depend on any particular simulation machinery (coalescent, forward-time, etc.), and therefore is a general tool for processing the results from any simulation. 6. The code is open-source, and modular.Examples of applying the software to empirical data from Drosophila melanogaster, and testing the procedure on simulated data, are shown.

	abstract = "Comparative proteomics is a powerful analytical method for learning about the responses of biological systems to changes in growth parameters. To make confident inferences about biological responses, proteomics approaches must incorporate appropriate statistical measures of quantitative data. In the present work we applied microarray-based normalization and statistical analysis (significance testing) methods to analyze quantitative proteomics data generated from the metabolic labeling of a marine bacterium (Sphingopyxis alaskensis). Quantitative data were generated for 1,172 proteins, representing 1,736 high confidence protein identifications (54% genome coverage). To test approaches for normalization, cells were grown at a single temperature, metabolically labeled with (14)N or (15)N, and combined in different ratios to give an artificially skewed data set. Inspection of ratio versus average (MA) plots determined that a fixed value median normalization was most suitable for the data. To determine an appropriate statistical method for assessing differential abundance, a -fold change approach, Student's t test, unmoderated t test, and empirical Bayes moderated t test were applied to proteomics data from cells grown at two temperatures. Inverse metabolic labeling was used with multiple technical and biological replicates, and proteomics was performed on cells that were combined based on equal optical density of cultures (providing skewed data) or on cell extracts that were combined to give equal amounts of protein (no skew). To account for arbitrarily complex experiment-specific parameters, a linear modeling approach was used to analyze the data using the limma package in R/Bioconductor. A high quality list of statistically significant differentially abundant proteins was obtained by using lowess normalization (after inspection of MA plots) and applying the empirical Bayes moderated t test. The approach also effectively controlled for the number of false discoveries and corrected for the multiple testing problem using the Storey-Tibshirani false discovery rate (Storey, J.

	abstract = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Renal function and the plasma albumin concentration have been shown to correlate with clearance of total mycophenolic acid (MPA). The hypothesis for the underlying mechanism is that low plasma albumin concentrations and accumulation of the glucuronide metabolite of MPA (MPAG) decrease the binding of MPA to albumin. The subsequent increase in the unbound fraction (f(u)) of MPA (MPA(u)) produces an increase in total MPA (MPA(t)) clearance. This study aimed to develop an empirical population pharmacokinetic model to describe the relationships between renal function and albumin concentration and MPAG, MPA(u) and MPA(t), in order to provide insight into the mechanism by which renal function and plasma albumin affect the disposition of MPA. METHODS: 774 MPA(t), 479 MPA(u) and 772 total MPAG (MPAG(t)) plasma concentrations were available from 88 renal transplant recipients on days 11 and 140 after transplantation. Data were analysed using non-linear mixed-effects modelling. RESULTS: Time profiles of MPA(u) and MPAG(t) concentrations were adequately described by two 2-compartment pharmacokinetic models with a link between the central compartments, representing the glucuronidation of MPA(u) to form MPAG. MPA(t) concentrations were modelled using: [MPA(t)] = [MPA(u)] + [MPA(u)] * theta(pb), with [MPA(u)] * theta(pb) representing the bound MPA concentration, where [MPA(t)], [MPA(u)] and theta(pb) represent MPA(t) concentration, MPA(u) concentration and a factor that correlates to the total number of protein binding places, respectively. According to this equation, f(u) = [MPA(u)]/[MPA(t)] = 1/(1 + theta(pb)) * theta(pb), and therefore [MPA(t)], was significantly and independently correlated with creatinine clearance (CL(CR)), the plasma albumin concentration and the MPAG(t) concentration (all p < 0.001). A reduction in CL(CR) from 60 to 25 mL/min correlated with an increase in f(u) from 2.7% to 3.5%, accumulation of MPAG(t) concentrations from 50 to 150 mg/L correlated with an increase in f(u) from 2.8% to 3.7%, and a decrease in plasma albumin concentration from 40 to 30 g/L correlated with an increase in f(u) from 2.6% to 3.5%. No significant correlations were detected between MPA(u) clearance and the plasma albumin concentration or CL(CR).

Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) derived an expression for the posterior odds of differential expression in a replicated two-color experiment using a simple hierarchical parametric model. The purpose of this paper is to develop the hierarchical model of Lonnstedt and Speed (2002) into a practical approach for general microarray experiments with arbitrary numbers of treatments and RNA samples. The model is reset in the context of general linear models with arbitrary coefficients and contrasts of interest. The approach applies equally well to both single channel and two color microarray experiments. Consistent, closed form estimators are derived for the hyperparameters in the model. The estimators proposed have robust behavior even for small numbers of arrays and allow for incomplete data arising from spot filtering or spot quality weights. The posterior odds statistic is reformulated in terms of a moderated t-statistic in which posterior residual standard deviations are used in place of ordinary standard deviations. The empirical Bayes approach is equivalent to shrinkage of the estimated sample variances towards a pooled estimate, resulting in far more stable inference when the number of arrays is small. The use of moderated t-statistics has the advantage over the posterior odds that the number of hyperparameters which need to estimated is reduced; in particular, knowledge of the non-null prior for the fold changes are not required. The moderated t-statistic is shown to follow a t-distribution with augmented degrees of freedom. The moderated t inferential approach extends to accommodate tests of composite null hypotheses through the use of moderated F-statistics. The performance of the methods is demonstrated in a simulation study. Results are presented for two publicly available data sets.",

	abstract = "With the increasing number of expression profiling technologies, researchers today are confronted with choosing the technology that has sufficient power with minimal sample size, in order to reduce cost and time. These depend on data variability, partly determined by sample type, preparation and processing. Objective measures that help experimental design, given own pilot data, are thus fundamental. Results. Relative power and sample size analysis were performed on two distinct data sets. The first set consisted of Affymetrix array data derived from a nutrigenomics experiment in which weak, intermediate and strong PPARα agonists were administered to wild-type and PPARα-null mice. Our analysis confirms the hierarchy of PPARα-activating compounds previously reported and the general idea that larger effect sizes positively contribute to the average power of the experiment. A simulation experiment was performed that mimicked the effect sizes seen in the first data set. The relative power was predicted but the estimates were slightly conservative. The second, more challenging, data set describes a microarray platform comparison study using hippocampal δC-doublecortin-like kinase transgenic mice that were compared to wild-type mice, which was combined with results from Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing runs. As expected, the choice of technology greatly influences the performance of the experiment. Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing has the highest overall power followed by the microarray platforms Agilent and Affymetrix. Interestingly, Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing displays comparable power across all intensity ranges, in contrast with microarray platforms that have decreased power in the low intensity range due to background noise. This means that deep sequencing technology is especially more powerful in detecting differences in the low intensity range, compared to microarray platforms. Conclusion. Power and sample size analysis based on pilot data give valuable information on the performance of the experiment and can thereby guide further decisions on experimental design. Solexa/Illumina deep sequencing is the technology of choice if interest lies in genes expressed in the low-intensity range. Researchers can get guidance on experimental design using our approach on their own pilot data implemented as a BioConductor package, SSPA http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SSPA.html.",

	abstract = "In the design of microarray or next-generation sequencing experiments it is crucial to choose the appropriate number of biological replicates. As often the number of differentially expressed genes and their effect sizes are small and too few replicates will lead to insufficient power to detect these. On the other hand, too many replicates unnecessary leads to high experimental costs. Power and sample size analysis can guide experimentalist in choosing the appropriate number of biological replicates. Several methods for power and sample size analysis have recently been proposed for microarray data. However, most of these are restricted to two group comparisons and require user-defined effect sizes. Here we propose a pilot-data based method for power and sample size analysis which can handle more general experimental designs and uses pilot-data to obtain estimates of the effect sizes. The method can also handle χ2 distributed test statistics which enables power and sample size calculations for a much wider class of models, including high-dimensional generalized linear models which are used, e.g., for RNA-seq data analysis. The performance of the method is evaluated using simulated and experimental data from several microarray and next-generation sequencing experiments. Furthermore, we compare our proposed method for estimation of the density of effect sizes from pilot data with a recent proposed method specific for two group comparisons.",
